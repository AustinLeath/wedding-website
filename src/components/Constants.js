  INTRO1: `
    Martha's Vineyard is a vacation destination, which means that there are lots of places to stay. While
    October is off-season on the Island, our wedding weekend is still a popular one. We recommend
    making plans and booking accomodations early. You'll get the best rate, and have peace of mind!
  `,
  INTRO2: `
    The two main accomodation options are finding a rental home from AirBNB or Homeaway, or staying in one of
    the hotels or B&Bs around town. We recommend staying in Edgartown, with its beautiful streets and homes,
    incredible restaurants, and fun shopping and things to do. The ceremony and reception are both right in the
    heart of downtown Edgartown, so you'll be close to where you need to be. Any necessary transportation will
    be coordinated from there as well.

  RENTAL_HOMES: {
    HEADER: 'Rental Homes',
    BODY: `
      Rental Homes are a staple of a trip to Martha's Vineyard. Whether coming for a long weekend or a two week
      getaway, island-goers favor finding a beautiful home to call their own for their stay and get the full taste
      of life on the island. We recommend getting some friends or family together and booking a rental home
      together. It will be the most cost-effective and fun way to stay for the weekend; it's the best Martha's
      Vineyard experience, and it's what Makayla's family has been doing for almost a decade.
